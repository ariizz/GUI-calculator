# Tkinter Calculator 🧮

Hey there! Welcome to my Tkinter Calculator, a sleek and simple GUI calculator built with Python and Tkinter. I created this project to explore GUI programming and make math fun and interactive. Whether you're crunching numbers or just curious, this calculator is here to help with a clean design and smooth functionality!

# 🚀 Features

Basic Arithmetic: Add (+), subtract (-), multiply (×), and divide (÷) with ease.
Parentheses Support: Handle complex expressions like (2 + 3) * 4.
Clear Button: Reset everything with a single click.
Error Handling: Get a friendly "Error" message if something goes wrong (like dividing by zero).
Dark Theme UI: A modern, eye-friendly design with a dark background and crisp white text.

#💡 Why I Built This

I’m passionate about coding and love turning ideas into reality. This is my first GUI project, though it is very basic but I learnt a LOT while building this. This calculator was a fun way to dive into Python’s Tkinter library, tackle UI design challenges, and make something useful. I tweaked the layout to make the buttons look snug and polished, which taught me a ton about GUI programming. Hopefully, it inspires you to build something cool too!

# 🔧 Future Ideas

Add scientific functions (like sin, cos, or square root).
Support keyboard input for faster calculations.
Make it resizable for different screen sizes.
